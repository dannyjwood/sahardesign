        <title>6 Best Online Courses</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love to learn new skills! Whether itâ€™s for my professional life or personal, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve. How about you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m assuming yes, because youâ€™ve navigated to this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As designers, our field is always changing. Yet instead of taking night classes at a local college or University, we can rely on the Internet to help update our skill sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully thereâ€™s a plethora of online courses available and at any price point. You can easily become a Photoshop pro or earn a certificate in social media online. The options are endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally learn better by watching videos, and if you are like me, youâ€™ll find the resources below helpful. Theyâ€™ve definitely helped me throughout the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my top 6 favourite online learning tools and courses you can use to help further your expertise. Best part, you can learn at your pace and track your progress. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;01-lyndacom&quot;&gt;01. LYNDA.COM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/learning_lynda.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynda.com founded by Lynda Weinman is one of the most popular websites for online training and offers a wide variety of high-quality courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve been a Lynda.com subscriber for over 10 years and I check out a topic every few weeks. I joined their website when they only had a handful of subjects. Now you can find tutorials on most subjects through their site. They also have an amazing selection of influencer interviews that Iâ€™m a big fan of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynda.com was recently acquired by LinkedIn. If you have a LinkedIn account you can now connect the two and have your completed courses show up on your LinkedIn profile as lynda.com certificates. This can be a plus if you are looking for a job ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more at lynda.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;02treehouse&quot;&gt;02.TREEHOUSE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/learning_threehouse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treehouse is more focused on web and mobile development than other desktop applications. Through their courses youâ€™ll be able to learn about HTML, CSS, WordPress, and iOS platforms for app development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have over 1000 videos created by expert teachers on web design, coding and business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treehouse breaks courses down into easy-to-digest chunks with quizzes and mini-challenges which are fun to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more at teamtreehouse.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;03-skillshare&quot;&gt;03. SKILLSHARE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/learning_skillshare.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skillshare is a learning community for creators. Anyone can take an online class, watch video lessons, create projects, and even teach a class themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite courses on Skillshare is Lettering for Designers: One Drop Cap Letterform at a Time by Jessica Hische a San Francisco based illustrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more at skillshare.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;04-udemy&quot;&gt;04. UDEMY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/learning_udemy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udemy has a massive and varied catalog of self-paced online courses, many of which are free. It enables professionals to share or sell their expertise through courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udemy courses are divided into sections and lectures. Lectures can be video micro-lectures, but they can also include audio, text, and presentation slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite course on Udemy is Seth Godinâ€™s Freelancer course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more at udemy.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;05the-creative-class&quot;&gt;05.THE CREATIVE CLASS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/learning_creativeclass.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Creative Class by Paul Jarvis is an online business course for freelancers to help get more clients, better pay for designers, developers, writers and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a long time to find a good course like The Creative Class. Learning the business side of things through this course will prove to be invaluable in your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Paulâ€™s style of teaching, since he gives examples from his personal experiences. Itâ€™s nice to learn from an entrepreneur who has over 20 years of experience as a freelancer and who also understands the design side of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you sign up for his course youâ€™ll also get access to a Slack channel where you can connect with hundreds of other freelancers to chat, brainstorm, talk pricing and get feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more at creativeclass.io&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;06-b-school&quot;&gt;06. B-SCHOOL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/learning_bschool.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HOW TO CREATE AN EFFECTIVE STYLE GUIDE</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most important aspects in having a successful brand is consistency.
A consistent brand makes the visual aspects easily identified, and creates trust between your business and your customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One easy way to maintain visual consistency is by creating a style guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A style guide is a document that outlines the specific logos, colors, typography, imagery, etc. of your companyâ€™s brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having worked with different agencies for many years, I have come across many different style guides, and Iâ€™ve seen some that are over 100 pages, and some that are as short as a single sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You donâ€™t have to be a big brand to make use of the style guide benefits. Even as a small startup or a one person business, creating this document can help you with your online presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every brand style guide will need different information depending on how complex your brand may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listed below are few basic elements that most likely can appear on every visual guide. And to help you have a better understanding, I have included samples of the style guide I created for our company Strutta plus few examples from other brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;01-logo&quot;&gt;01. LOGO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your logo is a key element of your brand, and in order to stay consistent along the way your guide needs to define exactly how it should be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create at least 2 versions of the logo: one for light and one for dark background&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define space between the Logotype and other elements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specify the minimum size for your logo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beware how not to use the logo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/post_styleguide_logo1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/post_styleguide_logo2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/post_styleguide_logo3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;02-color&quot;&gt;02. COLOR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since colors can be easily shifted from designer to designer or application to application, make sure to specify the values to the point so you donâ€™t end up with a color that clashes with your original design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give exact RGB color code as well as CMYK and Pantone for print use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Include a set of secondary colors along with the primary ones&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick neutral colors (white, grey and black) so your primary brand colors can stand out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use sites such as LOLcolors, Adobe Color for inspiration and creating sets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/post_styleguide_color1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/post_styleguide_color2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/post_styleguide_color3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;03-typography&quot;&gt;03. TYPOGRAPHY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every brand should have a consistent set of fonts. Listing out these fonts, with examples and character sets, is very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stick to 2 or 3 fonts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specify sizes for elements such as headings, sub headings and body text&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose weights and font styles within a font family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/post_styleguide_type1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/post_styleguide_type2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;04-imagery&quot;&gt;04. IMAGERY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your images reflect your brand just as much as your graphic elements, logo, fonts and colors and can help you set your brand apart from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specify a photographic style for your brand (bright, high contract, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define how and where photos should be used within your brand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose a subject line for your photos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create your style around the photos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/post_styleguide_imagery2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/post_styleguide_imagery3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you find the above tips helpful to create your own style guide. Itâ€™s essential to begin with what is most necessary for you and take it from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s also important to realize that brands evolve over time. The style guide you create today might be different than the one youâ€™re using in a year. So its good practice to version your guides with date and always keep the old versions so you can refer back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please share your comments blow.&lt;/p&gt;
